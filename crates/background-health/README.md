# Background task health

[简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

`maka.background-health` is a statically linked Profile plugin exposing the
`BackgroundTaskHealth` Agent tool.

Input: `ref` from Shell, optional `include_logs` (false by default), optional
HTTP(S) `url`. The plugin reads the canonical Shell snapshot through Host's
Agent-authorized `Read(ref)` service. It cannot inspect another Session's task,
reattach a PID, or infer liveness after Host recovery marks a task orphaned.
Read must be available within the Agent's tool ceiling. Timestamps describe the
persisted snapshot; `updatedAt` is not a heartbeat or last-output guarantee.

Process state and endpoint health are separate observations. HEAD falls back to
GET only for 405/501. Responses are discarded and settled; redirects are never
followed. 2xx means healthy, 3xx unknown, and 4xx/5xx unhealthy. Connection failures,
denied access and timeouts mean unknown. Endpoint responses do not prove that the
tracked process owns the listener or that a browser application is ready.

Network permission interaction and transport timeouts are owned by Host. The
plugin does not time out a user awaiting permission approval. `elapsedMs` includes
that approval time. Cancellation drains the child scope; unconfirmed cleanup is
an error. Incognito permits local task observation but skips endpoint probing.
Logs are opt-in and retain Host's bounded output representation.

This plugin has no Remote endpoint or private process registry. Tests cover the
real Agent → Files → Shell path and cross-Session denial, plus HTTP fallback,
body disposal, cancellation and privacy.
