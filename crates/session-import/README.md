# Session import

[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Converts Codex, Claude Code and OpenCode conversations into historical records through public plugin read capabilities. Callers supply the selected source identity and a pinned file or authorized database read view. This crate cannot open ambient paths, dispatch tools or write canonical events.

- Codex uses conversation events and tool response items, applies recorded rollbacks, and excludes provider message mirrors.
- Claude selects rewritten prompts without dropping parallel results or compaction roots. Three digest-checked passes resolve lineage, assemble response fragments and emit history.
- OpenCode reads the selected root Session, messages and parts in one SQLite snapshot, applying whole-message and partial-message reverts. Invalid cells, duplicate identities, orphan parts and missing completed-tool outcomes fail the import; pending calls remain pending.
- Tool calls and results retain their source order and correlation. Missing outcomes stay missing.
- Filesystem catalogs read bounded summaries (Codex: 512 KiB; Claude: 256 KiB head and tail), apply workspace/archive filters, and paginate by modification time and relative path. Query-bound cursors resume after the last delivered entry, including when the 48 KiB wire budget cuts a page short.
- OpenCode catalogs read root Sessions in bounded database batches, ordered by source time and identity. Workspace and text matching use the same normalization as filesystem catalogs; cursors bind the query and database. Pages observe a live source, not a retained snapshot.
- Codex catalogs select the highest `state_N.sqlite` generation and read at most 100,000 index entries under the public database budget. Rust normalizes timestamps and retains only the next page's candidates; rollout paths still require the public file capability. An unavailable initial database falls back to files, never an older database. Continuations retain their selected generation or filesystem source.
- Source workspace/model values are observations, not execution configuration. No credentials or provider options enter the result.
- Corrupt interior JSON, inconsistent source identity and changing multi-pass input fail the import. Only an unfinished final JSON write is omitted and identified in the fingerprint.

JSONL reads are bounded: 2 GiB per source prefix, 64 MiB per line, one million lines and 65,536 structural JSON tokens per record. OpenCode snapshots also obey the public database row, byte and work limits. Retained payloads are checked before decoding; encoded history is limited to the Runtime's 6 MiB / 7,500-record budget. Claude additionally bounds its lineage index and response fragments. Oversized input is rejected, not truncated.

Source configuration uses revision-checked plugin storage. A prepared import atomically saves its explicit destination and normalized payload; removing or changing a source does not change that intent. Delivery reauthorizes the saved destination, queries the Host receipt, appends only the missing suffix, then publishes. Terminal receipts and payload reclamation commit together. Retrying the same operation never creates another copy.

The built-in plugin publishes a native terminal view and a `maka.session-import/manage` Remote endpoint. Both use the same typed handler for sources, catalogs, model choices, preparation, delivery, abandonment and paged copy history. All capabilities are public plugin APIs. Canonical publication and receipts remain Host-owned; the Host's history limit includes event envelopes, not just converted record bytes.

The Client requires an explicit destination Host workspace and execution configuration. Failed replies and refreshes retain the operation identity; only a confirmed receipt or explicitly setting the attempt aside clears it. Saved imports remain available after reopening the page or restarting the Host.

Run Client recovery acceptance with `node --test crates/session-import/tests/client.test.mjs` from the repository root.
