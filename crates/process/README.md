# maka-process

[中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Native process and PTY transport, cancellation, sandbox launch integration and
headless terminal state for Linux, macOS and Windows.

`Shell` captures the executable once for command execution and interactive PTYs.
On Unix it prefers a supported, executable account login shell (not `$SHELL`).
Fallback order is zsh → bash → sh on macOS, bash → zsh → sh on Linux;
Windows prefers PowerShell 7 → Windows PowerShell → cmd. Model guidance names
the selected dialect. Commands load login profiles by default; `login: false`
skips them. Profile loading remains inside the same sandbox and timeout.

`terminal::Screen` uses `alacritty_terminal` without its PTY event loop or renderer.
The existing PTY worker owns the parser; no JavaScript runtime, extra thread or
cross-runtime serialization is needed. The Host retains admission, canonical
records, backpressure and final output drain.

Snapshots expose the viewport, 500 rows of history, cursor/input modes and the
last alternate screen. History loss or text-budget clipping sets `truncated`.
Writes, escape expansion, combining characters, OSC storage and protocol replies
are bounded. A failed parser cannot publish partial state; the Host retains its
last successful snapshot. Clipboard, title and hyperlink effects are suppressed.
Terminal escape handling follows Alacritty, not exact xterm emulation.
