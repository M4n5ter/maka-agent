A bilingual Astro homepage and download guide with an independent manifest and lockfile.

```sh
just website-setup
just website-dev
just website-check
```

Commands can also be run from this directory with npm. Site dependency changes update `website/package-lock.json`.

Copy lives in `src/copy/`; both languages share one type and the built-page tests verify navigation, link previews, accessibility metadata and local asset loading. Product and contributor guidance links to the repository's maintained documents.

The design tokens live in `src/styles/site.css`. Geist and Geist Mono are self-hosted under the SIL Open Font License. `assets/logo.png` is the product mark; `src/assets/incubator.png` is the unmodified Apache Incubator logo from https://www.apache.org/logos/res/incubator/default.png, used as an ASF trademark.

After changing the hero, run `npm --prefix website run social-preview` from the repository root to regenerate the localized social images and their text manifest.

`.github/workflows/website.yml` validates pull requests and publishes from main to `asf-site`. Release-candidate tags and explicit stage names publish to `site/<name>-staging`; non-main refs require a stage name. Only the built site, its license/notice and site configuration are published.
